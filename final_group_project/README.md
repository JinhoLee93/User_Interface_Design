# Final Group Project

We designed an application that helps Columbia students easily reserve seats in various libraries on campus. <br>
We thought that, if our users have ever been college students, they must understand how harrowing of experiences it is getting a seat in a library.
To us, the developers, it felt like it was more morbid in Columbia than any other colleges to secure a seat in a school library due to the favorable geological location of Columbia University in New York City and its massive student body. 
However, the problem was not with the number of the libraries on campus. There are plenty of seats and libraries. The problem, we thought, was lack of system that controls population flow.
For example, even though there are more than five libraries on campus, many students leave their stuff on their newly, or previously-secured seats unattended, so, during the exam seasons, some sort of inextricable bottleneck effect in the number of the seats in the libraries happens (and fights really do happen over seats here and there in the libraries). 
We thought this inevitable mayhem could be solved by a check-in and out system in place that can be implemented in the forms of a physical kiosk, an application and a web-based platform.
Some libraries all over the world are already implementing this idea and we tried to improve it in terms of user experiences and accessibility (with better visual flares as a bonus).

- The report contains various and specific information of the app design and our thought-process that went into the project.
- Every group member had to participate in each task at hand, but they were responsible for organizing the structures of the topics of their choices. 
  - I was in charge of organizing Comparative Analysis, Risks to Mitigate, Project Task, and Future Plans.

The design contains two separate parts, one for the smartphone app and the web-based platform and the other for the physical check-in and out kiosk.
We created prototypes of the interfaces for each part using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) so that what we have in our mind can be visualized.

- Contains the intended visuals for the interface design of the app and the platform. 

**[FIGMA (KIOSK)](https://github.com/JinhoLee93/User_Interface_Design/blob/main/final_group_project/FIGMA%20(KIOSKS).pdf)**
- Contains the intended visuals for the interface design of the kiosk.
