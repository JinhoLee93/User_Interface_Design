**[UI Final Report](https://github.com/JinhoLee93/User_Interface_Design/blob/main/final_group_project/UI%20FINAL%20REPORT.pdf)**
- The report contains various and specific information of the app design and our thought-process that went into the project.

The design contains two separate parts, one for the smartphone app and the web-based platform and the other for the physical check-in and out kiosk.
We created prototypes of the interfaces for each part with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) so that what we have in our mind can be visualized.
